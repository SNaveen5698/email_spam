Title:
"Email Spam Classification: Identifying Unwanted Messages"

Summary:
This project focuses on classifying emails as spam or non-spam (ham) using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization for text data, training a Logistic Regression model, evaluating model performance, and predicting spam emails.

Methodology:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loaded the dataset and removed irrelevant columns like "Unnamed" columns.
Text Vectorization: Utilized TF-IDF Vectorization to convert email text into numerical features.
Model Training: Employed Logistic Regression for training the spam classification model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model accuracy using the test set.
Prediction: Demonstrated the model's ability to predict spam emails using sample email text.
Achievements:

Developed a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying email spam.
Achieved a high accuracy score on the test set, indicating the model's effectiveness.
Showcased the model's practical application in predicting spam emails based on their content.
